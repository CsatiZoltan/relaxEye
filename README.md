# relaxEye
Notifier to relax the eyes after a given time.

## Purpose
It is recommended to take a ten-minute break after an hour of sitting in front of your screen to relax your eyes. However, many people - including me - forgets about it. This simple command line program makes a short beep to make you remember.

## Installation
There are two branches. The `master` branch contains the Windows version, the `linux` branch the Linux version of the code. Any C compiler can create the executable. For the Windows version, a precompiled executable is provided.

## Usage
Syntax:

`relaxEye nMinute` - rethrows the notification in every `nMinute` minutes.

`relaxEye` - rethrows the notification in every 60 minutes.
